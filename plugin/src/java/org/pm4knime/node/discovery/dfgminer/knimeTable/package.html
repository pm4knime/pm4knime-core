This node implements the second step of the Inductive Miner to discover a process tree from a directly-follows graph.
<p>
This node wraps the second step of the ProM's plug-in "Mine efficient tree with Inductive Miner" from the package InductiveMiner.
        This node is used to discover a process tree from a directly-follows graph (DFG).
        A process tree is a block-structured process model where the (inner) nodes are operators (such as sequence, choice, parallel, and loop) and the leaves are activities. 
        The inductive miner guarantees the discovery of a sound process model. 
		The discovered process tree can be converted into a Petri net.
