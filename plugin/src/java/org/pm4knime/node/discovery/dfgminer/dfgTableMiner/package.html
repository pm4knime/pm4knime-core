This node implements the first step of the Inductive Miner to discover a directly-follows graph from an event table.
<p>
 This node wraps the first step of the ProM's plug-in "Mine efficient tree with Inductive Miner" from the package InductiveMiner.
        This node is used to discover a directly-follows graph (DFG) from an event table. 
        A DFG consists of nodes representing activities and directed edges connecting nodes to model the directly-follows relations between activities. 
        The green nodes represent the start activities, while the red ones are for the end activities.
