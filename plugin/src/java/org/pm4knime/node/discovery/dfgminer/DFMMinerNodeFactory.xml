    <fullDescription>
        <intro> This node is created to discover a directly-follows graph. It accepts an event log as input and generates a directly-follows graph as output.
        In this package without notification, directly-follows graph  is abbreviated as DFG. A DFG is composed of activities in rectangles, 
        which are connected by arcs for directly-follows relation. The green rectangles represent the start activities, while the red
        ones are for the end activities.

         <option name="Event classifer">The classifier chosen to classify the event log. The event log classifiers from event log and 
        event attributes can be used as classifier.</option>
        <option name="Variant">The variant type used to extract one directly-follows graph from event log. There are three options. </option>
