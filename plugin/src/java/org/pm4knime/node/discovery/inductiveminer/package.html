This node implements the Inductive Miner to discover a process tree from an event log.
<p>
This node wraps the ProM's plug-in "Mine process tree with Inductive Miner".
        This node is used to discover a process tree from an event log.
        A process tree is a block-structured process model where the (inner) nodes are operators (such as sequence, choice, parallel, and loop) and the leaves are activities. 
        The inductive miner guarantees the discovery of a sound process model. 
		The discovered process tree can be converted into a Petri net.
