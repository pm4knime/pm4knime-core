This node implements the Heuristics Miner to discover a Petri net from an event log.
<p>
This node wraps the ProM's plug-in "Mine for a Heuristics Net using Heuristics Miner" from the package HeuristicsMiner.
			It implements the Heuristics Miner to discover a Petri net from an event log.
			The Heuristics Miner discovers a heuristics net, which is a directed graph with activities as nodes and edges connecting nodes to model dependencies between activities.
			The discovered heuristics net is converted into a Petri net.
