This node implements the ILP Miner to discover a Petri net from an event log.
<p>
This node wraps the ProM's plug-in "ILP-Based Process Discovery" from the package HybridILPMiner.
		It implements the ILP Miner to discover a Petri net from an event log.
        Multiple algorithms based on transition theory and ILP are provided.
