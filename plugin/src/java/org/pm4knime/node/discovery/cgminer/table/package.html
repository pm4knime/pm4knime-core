This node implements the first step of the Hybrid Miner to discover a causal graph from an event table.
<p>
This node wraps the ProM's plug-in "Extended Causal Graph Miner" from the package ExtendedHybridMiner.
It implements the first step of the Hybrid Miner to discover a causal graph from an event log. 
A causal graph consists of nodes representing activities and two types of directed edges connecting nodes. 
Certain edges represent strong causal dependencies and uncertain edges represent weak dependencies. 
A third type of edges is used to represent long-term dependencies.
