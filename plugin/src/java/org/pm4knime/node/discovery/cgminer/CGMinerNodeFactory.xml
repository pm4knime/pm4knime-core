	<shortDescription>This node implements the first step of the Hybrid Miner to discover a causal graph from an event log.</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node wraps the ProM's plug-in "Extended Causal Graph Miner" from the package ExtendedHybridMiner.
			It implements the first step of the Hybrid Miner to discover a causal graph from an event log. 
			A causal graph consists of nodes representing activities and two types of directed edges connecting nodes. 
			Certain edges represent strong causal dependencies and uncertain edges represent weak dependencies. 
			A third type of edges is used to represent long-term dependencies.

        <option name="Minimal activity frequency">An activity will be included if it occurs in at least x% of cases; set to 0 to include all activities.
		</option>
		<option name="Minimal trace variant frequency">A trace variant will be included if it covers at least x% of cases; set to 0 to include all trace variants.
		</option>


		<option name="Strong causality threshold">Lower bound for a strong causality between two activities.
		</option>
		<option name="Weak causality threshold">Lower bound for a weak causality between two activities; >set to 100% to avoid uncertain edges.
		</option>
		<option name="Long-term dependency threshold">Lower bound for a strong long-term causality between two activities.
		</option>
		<option name="Causality weight threshold">High values mean more emphasis on the split and join behavior of activities; low values mean more emphasis on the detection of concurrency and loops.</option>
