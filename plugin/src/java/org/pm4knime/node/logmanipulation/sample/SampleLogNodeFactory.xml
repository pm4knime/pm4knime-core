        <intro>
        This node is used to randomly sample a percentage of traces from the event log. 
        After sampling, it outputs two event logs: the sampled event log and the event log that contains the removed traces.</intro>
        
        <option name="Use Percentage">If checked, the sampling number is used as the percentage of traces to be kept. 
        Otherwise, the sampling number is used as the number of traces to be kept.</option>
        <option name="Sampling Number">
         <br/>If "Use Percentage" is checked, the sampling number must be between 0 and 1.0 to set the percentage of traces to be kept.
         <br/>Otherwise, the sampling number must be a non-negative integer to set the number of traces to be kept.</option>
