         <option name="Keep">The filtering strategy. If "keep"" is chosen, the traces that meet the filtering threshold will be kept.
        Otherwise, the traces that meet the filtering threshold will removed.</option>
        <option name="Minimum trace length ">The minimum length of trace. It is a positive integer. 
        When a negative value is given, the default value 1 is used instead. 
        When a double value is given, it is casted down. 
        It should be greater or equal than the minimum length. Otherwise, 
        a configuration exception is thrown.</option>
        <option name="Maximum trace length">The maximum length of trace. It is a positive integer.
        When a negative value is given, the default value 1 is automatically set. 
        When a double value is given, it is casted down. 
        It should be greater or equal than the minimum length. Otherwise, 
        a configuration exception is thrown. </option>
