        <intro>
    This node implements a JavaScript visualization of Process Trees.
    <br />
    A process tree is a block-structured process model where the (inner) nodes are operators (sequence, choice, parallel, and loop) and the leaves are activities. 
    <br /> 
    The "seq" operator executes its children from right to left.
    <br />
    The "xor" operator executes one of its children.
    <br />
    The "and" operator executes the children in parallel.
    <br />
    The "xor loop" operator models a do-redo loop. The first child is used as the do part, while an exclusive choice between the other children is used as the redo part.
