	<name>Alignment-Based Replayer</name>

	<shortDescription>
		This node implements the alignment-based replayer for constructing the optimal alignments by replaying an event log on a Petri net.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		This node wraps the ProM's plug-in "Replay a Log on Petri Net for Conformance Analysis" from the package PNetReplayer. 
		It implements the alignment-based replayer, which accepts an event log and a Petri net as input and outputs the optimal alignments of the traces after replaying the event log on the Petri net.	
		Alignment-based replay is the state-of-the-art technique in conformance checking.
		Alignments provide a robust and detailed view on the deviations between the log and the model. 
		
		Three types of moves are considered while constructing the alignments:
		<ul>
		<li>Sync Move: <br/>
		The classification of the current event corresponds to the firing transitions in Petri net.
		In this case, during replaying, both the trace and the process model move to next comparison.
		</li>
  
				<li>Log Move:<br/>
				The classification of the current event doesn't have any
					corresponding firing transitions in Petri net.
					During replaying, the trace moves forward but the state of process model doesn't change.
				</li>

				<li>Model Move:<br/>
				The firing transitions in Petri net have no corresponding event in the trace.
					During replaying, the model moves forwards but the state of the event log doesn't change.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<br />

		<option name="Event classifer">The attribute to be used as an event classifier.
		</option>
		<option name="Strategy type">
			The replay strategy to be applied. The following options are available:
				<ul>
				<li>
					ILP Replayer: this repalyer calculates the optimal alignment based on ILP.
				</li>
				<li> Non-ILP Replayer.
				</li>
				<li>
					A*-ILP Based Manifest Replayer: this replayer is reserved for performance checking. It generates
					the Manifest to wrap the alignments.
				</li>
				</ul>
		</option>

		<option name="Move on log cost">The unified cost for a log move in a non-negative
			integer. In default, it is 1.</option>
		<option name="Move on model cost">The unified cost for a model move in a non-negative
			integer. In default, it is 1.</option>
		<option name="Sync move cost">The unified cost for a sync move in a non-negative
			integer. In default, it is 0.</option>

		<option name="Move on log cost table">
			The cost table for log moves in non-negative integers.
			<br />
			The cost table provides the ability to modify cost for each move.
			The unified move cost can assign the same cost to all items in the table.
		</option>
		<option name="Move on model cost table">The cost table for model moves in non-negative integers.</option>
		<option name="Sync move cost table">The cost table for sync moves in non-negative integers. </option>
